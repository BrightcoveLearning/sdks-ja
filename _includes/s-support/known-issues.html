      <dt>Recurring events still published when inactive show the last 3 segments of playback</dt>
      <dd>
        If an SEP recurring event is still published on a page and the client is not currently streaming and the result is that the last 3 segments (about 18 seconds) are cached and will play back.
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Workaround</p>
        <p>One way of preventing this is to implement a <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/code-samples/brightcove-player-sample-live-custom-error-message.html">Live custom error message in the player</a> by adding plugin including code some like the following:</p>
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// Listen for a change on the durationmyPlayer.on("durationchange", ()=>{
// Save the duration to a local variable
var duration = myPlayer.duration();

// Check if the duration is a finite number (VOD)
// or if it's infinite (Live).
// If it's a VOD it would mean that the recurrent stream is over
// and the custom image would be displayed.
var isLive = !Number.isFinite(myPlayer.duration())

if(!isLive && duration !== 0){myPlayer.pause();myModal.open();</code></pre>

      <dd>When using multiple filters, an AND operation will be used. For example, if you add two filters, <strong>video tag</strong> and <strong>player</strong>, only videos with the specified tags <strong>and</strong> viewed in the specified player will be returned.</dd>
      <dt><strong>Custom Reports using the Filter by Video Tag functionality</strong></dt>
      <dd>When creating a custom report, there is a limitation when using the Filter by Video Tag functionality. It only takes into consideration up to 2,000 videos in your library with that specific tag. If the amount of videos with a specific tag is greater than that, we recommend to get an unfiltered report which includes the tags and perform the filtering locally with your spreadsheet software.</dd>
      <dt><strong>"Other/Third Party"</strong> Appears in Performance Report</dt>
      <dd>When a video that is not your Video Cloud library is played in a Video Cloud player (e.g a remote asset), <strong>Other/Third Party</strong> will be displayed with no associated video ID.</dd>
      <dt>Updated Video Names not Reflected in Analytics</dt>
      <dd>The only time Analytics learns about the title of a video is when the player sends it to Analytics as part of the playback beacon. If a video title is changed, analytics will not have the new video title until there has been a video playback. This can result in a scenario where a video name is updated and if there are no playbacks recorded, the old video name will be reflected in the Analytics reports. Data for time periods before March 2013 suffer from this issue often, and will show metadata that is only a number. For example, a video title might display as 1230123012. This is because data from this period was captured in the old analytics system.</dd>
      <dt>Video Names and Player Names Displaying ??????? in Analytics UI</dt>
      <dd>For the month of October 2013, the metadata (video names and player names) may look like a bunch of ?????s. This issue impacts publishers whose metadata has double byte characters and had video views in October 2013. This issue was related to the way that we were capturing the metadata for display in the Analytics UI. Starting in November 2013, the Analytics system has additional safeguards in place to prevent metadata sent with the event metrics from being corrupted.</dd>
      <dt>Reporting Time Zone</dt>
      <dd>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</dd>
      <dt>Engagement data are stored in daily granularity</dt>
      <dd>Engagement data are stored in daily granularity using UTC time and might sometimes include 2 full days of data in the "Audience at x%" table in the Engagement Report.</dd>

The most common cause that we have identified for this is a custom user_agent string created by Instagram, but there are probably others.</dd>

      <dd>Brightcove Player is known to behave poorly if there is an element with <code translate="No">id="default"</code> on the page. The blog post <a href="https://2ality.com/2012/08/ids-are-global.html">DOM: element IDs are global variables</a> explains why this is an issue. One common symptom of this problem is the <code translate="No">MEDIA_ERR_UNKNOWN</code> error.</dd>
      <dt>Ads blocked on Safari and/or iOS</dt>
      <dd>
        Changes made by Apple to cross-origin policies for Safari and iOS may result in ads not playing.
        <p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>
        <p>We have resolved this issue for SSAI by adding additional CORs headers. If you are using client-side ads, this will not address the issue, as the CORs headers have to be sent from your server or hosting service. The headers we added are:</p>
        <pre><code translate="No">access-control-allow-headers: Server,Range,Content-Length,Content-Range
          access-control-allow-headers: X-Requested-With,Origin,Range,Accept-Encoding,Referer

      </dd>
      <dt>Console warnings</dt>
      <p>Brightcove Player may generate <strong>warnings</strong> that appear in browser's console. The warnings, as opposed to error messages, are harmless and do not effect play back. An example of a warning is displayed here:</p>

      <dt>Internet Explorer always resets its playback rate to 1.0 whenever playback is paused.</dt>
      <dd>This will no longer be an issue in Safari 14 (Big Sur version).</dd>
      <dt>IE11 images for audio only content not displaying</dt>
      <dd>When playing only audio content in IE11, the video still image will not be displayed, only a black screen is seen. The image can be retained with the following code:

      <dt>Videos display greyish on Chrome and Firefox</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>When using Chrome and Firefox, videos in the Brightcove Player may display with a greyish color. This can be due to hardware acceleration and/or NVIDIA driver settings.</p>
        <p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Open the NVIDIA Control Panel. Under <strong>Video</strong> select <strong>Adjust video color settings</strong>. Under <strong>How do you make color adjustments</strong> select <strong>With the NVIDIA settings</strong>. Under <strong>Advanced</strong> make sure <strong>Dynamic Range</strong> is <strong>Full (0-255)</strong> not <strong>Limited (16-235)</strong>. <strong>Dynamic contrast enhancement</strong> should be unchecked.

      <dt>Using emulators</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Whether you are using Chrome Device Mode or other emulators to test video playback, be aware that emulators do not accurately represent how an actual device will perform. While you can use emulators for initial testing during development, it is best practice to use real devices for accurate results.</p>
        <p>When testing playback with Chrome Device Mode, you may see this message: "The use of Chrome in device mode simply renders the viewport and user agent string of that device in Chrome, which is not an accurate representation of how the actual device will perform."</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Using <code translate="No">data-setup </code></dt>
      <dd>You should NOT use <code translate="No">data-setup </code> with Brightcove Player. You may see use of <code translate="No">data-setup </code> in the API documentation, but this is because that documentation is generated directly from the Video.js player source code, and you MAY use that attribute with the <code translate="No">video </code> tag with pure Video.js. The attribute sends configuration information to the player, but Brightcove Player uses a different method to perform this task, which makes <code translate="No">data-setup </code> unreliable.</dd>
      <dt>Protocol-aware source selection and DASH</dt>
      <dd>Protocol-aware source selection is not available when using DASH content. It is only available for HLS and MP4 content</dd>
      <dt>Console error thrown when using iframe player implementation in Safari</dt>
      <dd>When using the iframe implementation of Brightcove Player in Safari you will see the following error message in the console: <strong>Blocked a frame with origin "http://players.brightcove.net" from accessing a frame with origin "#DOMAIN NAME#". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.</strong> The reported error does not affect playback.</dd>
      <dt>"Unknown" is displayed in the captions menu in Safari.</dt>
      <dd>This is a Safari/Apple limitation. Newer versions of the Brightcove Player use native captioning capabilities built into Safari and this is the standard behavior. This is documented by Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1801/_index.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1801/_index.html</a></dd>
      <dt>Fullscreen in non-Flash environments</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          In environments where Flash is disabled or Flash-based HLS is disabled for the player, and the player is explicitly sized using a <code translate="No">style </code> attribute on the <code translate="No">video </code> tag, fullscreen viewing may not function in some browsers.
        </p>
        <p>Workaround: remove the <code translate="No">style </code> attribute from the <code translate="No">video </code> tag, and instead create a rule in page stylesheet like this:</p>
        <pre>
  <code class="language-css" translate="No">.video-js{
  width:640px;
  height:360px;
  }
  </code>
  </pre>

      <dt>Social Sharing</dt>
      <dd>On desktops, the social sharing button will not be visible during ads.</dd>
      <dt>HTTPS</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>On most desktop browsers, the Brightcove Player will only play HLS on HTTPS web sites when both the manifest and the video segments are served over HTTPS connections. This is due to recent changes to several browsers that more severely restrict non-SSL content. This affects users of Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer on desktop computers. It does not affect Safari users or mobile browsers, and it does not affect playback of MP4 renditions.</p>
        <p>We are in the process of addressing this limitation for Video Cloud-managed assets; if you manage your own CDN and transcoding (remote assets), you must configure your CDN to support HTTPS delivery of both manifest and video content.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Full screen display</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>In newer browsers that support the fullscreen API, it's necessary to apply in-page CSS rules to ensure the player is scaled to 100% when switching to fullscreen. Otherwise, the player will appear at the original size within the fullscreen display. For details, see the <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/styling/sizing-player.html#fullscreen">Fullscreen display</a> topic in the <strong>Size the Player</strong> document.</p>
        <p>For IE10 and earlier, with no fullscreen API support, a new window will open, but the player will not be sized to fill the window. This is because no styles have been applied to resize the player. Since the window cannot be scrolled, you may only see a section of the website, with no player at all.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Multiple videos are published on a single page with HapYak chapters</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>When multiple videos are published on a single page with HapYak chapters, an incorrect chapter could be displayed.</p>
        <p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>
        <p>Use this script: <a href="https://github.com/brightcove/gallery-in-page-snippets/blob/master/snippets/hapyakFix.js">https://github.com/brightcove/gallery-in-page-snippets/blob/master/snippets/hapyakFix.js</a>. However, Flash playback (IE11/Win7) cannot avoid this issue, so the HTML5 fallback needs to be implemented in case of IE11/Win7.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>This error, caused by a known bug, can occur when switching between different formats, for instance MP4 and HLS, in a player. Until the bug is fixed, you can simply retry the code that is causing the issue. The following code is an example that corrected the error in an app:</p>
        <pre>
  <code class="language-javascript" translate="No">try {
  myPlayer.catalog.load(video);
  } catch (e) {
  myPlayer.catalog.load(video);

      <dt>RequireJS</dt>
      <dd>If you are using RequireJS you MAY have to use the <code translate="No">bc() </code> method to instantiate the player. The need to use the method will be determined by how/when the player assets are loaded. See the <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/coding-topics/requirejs-and-brightcove-player.html">RequireJS and Brightcove Player</a> document for more information.</dd>
      <dt>referrer_url vs. description_url</dt>
      <dd>The <code translate="No">referrer_url </code> value may have different values between iOS and Android devices. Because of this, it is recommended to use the <code translate="No">description_url </code> value instead. This value is consistent across all platforms and devices.</dd>
      <dt>loop attribute on Safari</dt>

      <dd>Brightcove Player version 5 uses the same icon for both chapters and subtitles. Since version 5 is in maintenance mode, and this being a cosmetic issue, it is doubtful the issue will be addressed.</dd>

        The Brightcove Player progress control and volume slider cannot be adjusted by the native gestures of TalkBack on Android. This is due to platform limitations. Instead, a user must interact with the element directly.
        On Android, a double tap with two fingers will allow the user to adjust the progress or volume to the position of the two finger double tap.
      </li>
      <li>On devices, the progress bar may not be in sync for HLS videos, since HLS does not work very well on Android. The total duration of the video may also incorrectly show up as 0:01.</li>
      <li>There are multiple accessibility issues with the <em>native</em> browser on both phones and tablets for all versions of Android. Talkback does not provide audio and vibration feedback for any of the player controls. (This issue does <em>not</em> apply to the add-on Chrome browser on Android devices, only to the native browser.</li>
      <li>On devices, the tap events for error messages do not bubble up to the parent video element. This means that you can not close an error message once it appears.</li>
      <li>On Android devices, when navigating the player menus in the controlbar, such as captions or quality selection, the menu can get "stuck" in the open state following a long press on an item in the menu. This is because Chrome adds the <code translate="No">:hover </code> pseudo-class. Another long press elsewhere on the player will typically close the menu.</li>

      <li>
        The Brightcove Player progress control and volume slider cannot be adjusted by the native gestures of VoiceOver on iOS. This is due to platform limitations. Instead, a user must interact with the element directly.
        On iOS, the user must double tap to select the progress bar or the volume slider and then a double tap and hold will allow the user to adjust the time or volume.

      <li>Safari on iOS never preloads. For details, see the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/AudioandVideoTagBasics/AudioandVideoTagBasics.html">Safari HTML5 Audio and Video Guide</a>.</li>
      <li>Player error occurs in iOS when switching to another app. When a video in Brightcove Player is played on an iOS device in Safari/Chrome, the player will error out after switching to another app, then switching back to Safari/Chrome after a minute or more.</li>

      <li><strong>Issue with renditions that have a low audio bitrate</strong>
        <p>Due to a bug on MSE on Chrome browser implementation documented here:</p>
        <p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=534301">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=534301</a></p>
        <p>Playback on that browser for version 5 and above of BC player will fail (showing MEDIA_ERR_DECODE) if the audio profile of the rendition being attempted is different from AAC-LC.</p>
        <p>To avoid this happening on new ingested content, customers need to make sure they either</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use an audio bitrate equals or greater than 48kbps</li>
          <li>include the following setting on their DI profile: <code translate="No">"max_aac_profile": "aac-lc" </code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To avoid this happening on existing content, options are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>retranscoding following the above recommendations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A request for an HTMl5 video may stay pending and the video never loads. See Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=234779">document</a> on the issue.</li>

      <li>Firefox Browser for Android: Not officially supported, but will try to address bugs if possible.</li>
      <li>It has been reported Firefox version 42 may have playback issues with Brightcove Player. The issue seems related to the settings of the Firefox <strong>Use Hardware Acceleration</strong> settings. When this is checked (enabled), the video player will playback the audio only, and will show a still image only. The solution to this problem is to disable this option as follows: <strong>Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; General -&gt; (UNCHECK) Use Hardware Acceleration When Available</strong></li>
      <li>The Brightcove Player may timeout on Firefox if the first frame of your video content has a starting presentation timestamp (pts) greater than 0. The current recommended solution is to re-encode your content. Note that re-encode does NOT mean re-transcode. The original master will need to be re-uploaded. If this does not fix the problem, contact <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.comlanguage=en_US">customer support</a> for further assistance.</li>

      <li>Videos with audio above 48khz will fail during playback on Edge and IE11 on Windows 8 and Windows 10. This is a Microsoft limitation.
