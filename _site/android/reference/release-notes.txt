Brightcove Native Player for Android Release Notes:

Version 6.18.6

  SDK Changes:
    * Fixes a threading issue in the Catalog class, which resulted in a requirement in SDK version 6.18.5 that the Catalog must be defined and instantiated only from the Player’s main thread. From version 6.18.6 onwards, the Catalog must still be defined within the Player Activity class, but instantiation can be called from other threads. Please refer to the Brightcove Android SDK Sample Apps for examples in defining and instantiating the Catalog.
    * Updates the GSON dependency version from 2.8.5 to 2.8.9 in response to a CVE report (CVE-2022-25647) about a possible vulnerability in some classes, none of which are used by the Brightcove SDK.
    
  ExoPlayer Changes:
    * Fixes an issue where a seek in a paused player would cause the seekbar’s scrubber to fail to update its progress.
    * Fixes an issue with Short Manifest TTLs where the Multi-Session DRM setting was not re-applied if the video was refreshed after its manifest timestamp expired.
    
Version 6.18.5

  SDK Changes:
    * Adds support for Short Manifest TTLs.
      IMPORTANT: Using this SDK version requires the Catalog and HttpRequestConfig objects to be created on the player’s main thread (in its onCreate method). This is a requirement independent of the use of the Short Manifest TTLs feature.

  SSAI Plugin Changes:
    * Adds support for Short Manifest TTLs.

Version 6.18.4

  SDK Changes:

    * Fixes an issue where a crash could occur if an account not configured for Generic Stream Concurrency (GSC) were to attempt to play content in a player that is configured for GSC.
    * Improves GSC error handling in cases where invalid or expired tokens might be used in attempting to play content.

Version 6.18.3

  SDK Changes:

    * Fixes an Accessibility issue where when the seekbar has focus, the video progress percentage is constantly read by the TalkBack system.
    * Fixes an Accessibility issue where double-tapping the video view would focus on the seekbar, and cause an unexpected seek into the video.

  ExoPlayer Changes:

    * Provides a getter method that returns the current instance of the WidevineMediaDrmCallback, or an empty instance if it needs to be created.

Thumbnail Plugin Changes:

    * Fixes an issue where Playlists with a mix of VideoCloud and remote videos would cause a thumbnail from the last-played VideoCloud video to be displayed when selecting a remote video.

Version 6.18.2

  SDK Changes:

    *  Fixed an issue where video_engagement Analytics events for remote VOD videos could have a video_seconds_viewed parameter instead of the expected range parameter.
    *  Fixed player button click listeners when using custom drawables.
    *  Fixed an issue where a call to NumberUtil.safeLongToInt might crash when its input is too large. Now, when the input can not be safely converted, the method returns Integer.MIN_VALUE with an explanatory message.
  
  ExoPlayer Changes:

    *  Fixed an issue where with mixed playlists with DRM and Clear content, playback failed if a Clear video is loaded after playing a DRM video.
    *  Added support for setting the “multiSession” property (required for key rotation) when creating the DefaultDrmSessionManager in ExoPlayer.

Version 6.18.1

  ExoPlayer Changes:
    *  Added a check to address a crash that could occur if the ExoPlayer instance becomes null and getCurrentManifest() is called in the ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent.
    
Version 6.18.0

  SDK Changes:

    * IMPORTANT: Support for integer data types in player, content and event properties is deprecated in the following areas of content and ad playback:
      Playhead position, for VOD and Live playback
      Video duration
      For a complete list of fields and methods that are migrated, please refer to the support pages for the Brightcove Native SDK for Android.

  SSAI Plugin Changes:

    * With this release, the SSAI plugin has been refactored to better support playback and seeking use cases. For a complete description of the
      behavioral and API-level changes to this plugin, please refer to the support pages for the Brightcove Native SDK for Android.
    * Fixes an issue where seeking in a paused player over ads could load the wrong player controls.

Version 6.17.3

  SDK Changes:

    * Fixes a Generic Stream Concurrency (GSC) issue where the second heartbeat request would follow the first request 30 seconds later, instead of the account-configured frequency.
    * Improvements to GSC heartbeat request functionality during Player Activity, Player Fragment and Picture-In-Picture lifecycle events, as well as retries on heartbeat request failures.

Version 6.17.2

  SDK Changes:

    * This version adds support for Generic Stream Concurrency (GSC). Please refer to the Brightcove Support Pages for more information.
      Limitations:
      * Chromecast is not supported in this version. Support for Chromecast will be included in a future release of the SDK.
      Known Issues:
      * When sending requests to the GSC heartbeat service, the second request will follow the first request 30 seconds later, instead of at the frequency set for the account. This issue only occurs on the second heartbeat request, does not affect playback, and will be addressed in a future release of the SDK.

Version 6.17.1

  ExoPlayer Changes:

      * Fixed an issue with overly verbose logging from the ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent

Version 6.17.0

  ExoPlayer Changes:

    The Brightcove Native Player SDK for Android now supports ExoPlayer 2.14.2. Please note the following changes:

      * In the ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent class the getBrightcoveDrmSession() : BrightcoveDrmSession method has been deprecated.
      Instead please use ExoPlayerDrmSessionManager<FrameworkMediaCrypto>. See  ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent:getExoPlayerDrmSessionManager() : 
      ExoPlayerDrmSessionManager

      * In the ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent class, in the InfoListener subclass the method onDecoderInitialized(AnalyticsListener.EventTime eventTime, int 
      trackType, String decoderName,long initializationDurationMs) has been deprecated.
      Instead please use onAudioDecoderInitialized(AnalyticsListener.EventTime eventTime, String decoderName, long initializationDurationMs) : void and/or 
      onVideoDecoderInitialized(AnalyticsListener.EventTime eventTime, String decoderName, long initializationDurationMs) : void.

      * The constructor for the ExoPlayerDrmSessionManager class has been deprecated, instead use the ExoPlayerDrmSessionManager.Builder.

      * The constructor for the OfflineLicenseManager class has been deprecated. The OfflineLicenseManager now uses the Builder pattern.
      See OfflineLicenseManager.Builder.

      * In the class TrackSelectoParameterFactory, the method DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters createWithMaxVideoBitrate(int maxVideoBitrate) has been 
      deprecated.
      Instead please use DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters createWithMaxVideoBitrate(Context context, int maxVideoBitrate).

      * In the class BrightcoveSegmentTemplate, the method getSegmentCount(long periodDurationUs) has been deprecated.
      Instead please use getSegmentCountLong(long periodDurationUs)

      * This ExoPlayer version requires that any instance of the ExoPlayer must be created and accessed in the main thread, so any access to the 
      ExoPlayerVideoDisplayComponent.getExoPlayer method or direct access to any ExoPlayer method must be on the main thread as well.Version 6.16.6
      
    The Brightcove Native Player SDK for Android now supports Android 11.

Version 6.16.6:

  SDK Changes:

      * Improved the video_seconds_viewed measurement in video_engagement events sent to the Brightcove Analytics back-end

  ExoPlayer Changes:

      * Fixed an issue where a device could go to sleep during ad playback

Version 6.16.5

  SDK Changes:

      * Improved support for 608/708 captions that have a language attribute
      * Emit a DID_SET_VIDEO_STILL_ERROR event when a video's poster image can not be loaded

  ExoPlayer Changes:

      * Emit an AD_ERROR error event if ad loading is interrupted, or if the ExoAdPlayer or its context are null

  Offline Playback Plugin Changes:

      * Fixed a problem where backgrounding or exiting the app could cause offline content to fail to play

Version 6.16.4

  Offline Playback Changes:

      * Fixed an issue where some image files would not download successfully.

Version 6.16.3

SDK Changes:

    * Added support for setting a label property in the BrightcoveCaptionFormat class to support sending selected caption and audio track information to a Cast receiver.
    * Updated the VideoUtils class to add a utility method to remove the sidecar caption sources from the Video object.
    * Fixed an issue where the video_duration URL parameter was not included in requests to Brightcove’s Analytics back-end for reporting.

Cast Plugin Changes:

    * Added support for setting a URL to a custom player for the Cast receiver app. Please refer to the Android SDK Support Documentation for more information.
    * Added support for sending selected caption and audio track information to a Cast receiver.
      Please Note that there is a known, non-regression issue that will be addressed in an upcoming release, where in-manifest caption selections are not automatically displayed
      on the sender if the Cast session is closed during playback. A workaround for this problem is that the selection made before opening the Cast session can be re-selected
      and displayed when the session is reopened on the Sender device.

Offline Playback Changes:

    * Added support for setting properties in the AbstractOfflineCatalog class. Offline Catalog properties can be set in two ways:
      * As a Map<String, String> of key/value pairs using the setProperties(Map<String, String>) method
      * Through the getProperties().put(key, value) method
    * Added support for creating custom NotificationChannels in the DownloadManager class. Please refer to the Android SDK Support Documentation for more information.

Version 6.16.2

  SDK Changes:

    * Fixed an issue where text tracks with the kind "subtitles" were not being parsed or displayed.

  ExoPlayer 2 Changes:

    * Fixed an issue where an incorrect index could be used to get the current selected audio language

  Omniture Plugin:

    * Fixed an issue where the heartbeat would continue after the player was destroyed.

  SSAI Plugin Changes

    * Added parsing support for nested VAST and VMAP Extension elements.
      Please Note:
      Extension elements, regardless of nesting depth, are not executed by the SSAI plugin, and so this support only ensures that parsing VAST and VMAP with nested Extension
      elements of any depth does not fail.
    * Added parsing support for VAST AdVerification elements.
      Please Note:
      AdVerification elements are not executed by the SSAI plugin, and so this support only ensures that parsing VAST with AdVerification elements does not fail. In addition,
      AdVerification elements are a VAST 4.0 feature, and the Brightcove Android SDK does not yet fully support VAST 4.x. This parsing support should not be considered as
      support for VAST 4.x in general in the Brightcove Native SDK for Android.

Version 6.16.1

  SDK Changes:

    * Improved Video Engagement reporting for SSAI VOD videos.
    * The DashWidevineAuthorizer class is deprecated. Please use the WidevineAuthorizer class instead.

    * Improved support for skippable ads, and fixed an issue where skippable ads might not exit cleanly, and ad audio might be heard after resuming content playback.
    * Fixed an issue with setting mime types for ads, where user-supplied mime types were not being set by the plugin's Builder.
    * Added plugin Builder convenience methods for:
      * Setting ad mime types in the AdsRenderingSettings object - see Builder.setMimeTypes(List<String>) : void
      * Setting the ad video load timeout in the AdsRenderingSettings object - see Builder.setLoadVideoTimeout(int) : void
      * Setting debug mode in the ImaSdkSettings object - see Builder.setDebugMode(boolean) : void

      Please note:
      * These convenience methods are member methods in the AdsRenderingSettings and ImaSdkSettings Google IMA SDK objects.
      * When called through the Builder directly, these methods will configure the AdsRenderingSettings and ImaSdkSettings
        objects that are created by default in the Builder.
      * If you decide to create custom AdsRenderingSettings and ImaSdkSettings Google IMA SDK objects for use in the IMA plugin,
        you can call those objects' methods directly:
        * AdsRenderingSettings.setMimeTypes(List<String>) : void
        * AdsRenderingSettings.setLoadVideoTimeout(int) : void
        * ImaSdkSettings.setDebugMode(boolean) : void

  SDK changes:

  HLS Player changes:

    * Modified SeamlessVideoDisplayComponent to turn off the video
      stream for the prebuffering player earlier during

    * Modified the GoogleIMAVideoAdPlayer to listen for SEEK_TO events
      and suppress reporting progress until playback has progressed at

      captioning for the current playing video.

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed issue where when starting playback from a non-zero
      position, playback would skip back to that non-zero position
      after the first ad finished.  This was a side effect of the fix
      in 4.1.18.

      using Ad Rules.

      onPlay() when ads began playback.

  OnceUx Plugin changes:

      update to the OpenSSL library from version 0.9.8m to version
      0.9.8za.

    * The .aar file now has the .so files in the jni/armeabi folder
      instead of in the armeabi.jar, which was a workaround and
      support for the workaroudn was recently removed from the Android
      Gradle Build Tools.

    * Updated to emit DID_INTERRUPT_CONTENT and DID_RESUME_CONTENT.

Version 4.1.14:

  SDK changes:

    * Added VERSION event.
